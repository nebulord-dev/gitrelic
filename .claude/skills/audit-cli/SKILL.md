# Audit: apps/cli

The published `gitrelic` package. Audit for correctness, robustness, and the invariants that keep it installable and safe when serving the web dashboard.

## Checklist

### 1. Packaging Invariant

The published `gitrelic` package has `@gitrelic/core: workspace:*` as a runtime dependency, but `@gitrelic/core` is `private: true` in its `package.json`. This is a latent publishing bug — once `pnpm publish` rewrites `workspace:*` to a real version, npm install will fail because core was never published.

Verify on every audit:

- Is `packages/core/package.json` still `"private": true`?
- Is there any bundling configured in `apps/cli/tsup.config.ts` (e.g. `noExternal: ['@gitrelic/core']`) that would inline core's source?
- Has the cli been published to npm? If yes, how does it actually resolve core at install time?

This is the single highest-priority finding — fix direction is either: make core public, bundle core into cli via tsup's `noExternal`, or stop publishing cli.

### 2. Commander Setup (`src/index.tsx`)

Flags: `--path`, `--branch`, `--since`, `--web`, `--json`, `--shame`, `--parallel`.

- Does `--path` get validated as an existing directory before `runGitrelic` is called? What happens with a path that exists but isn't a git repo?
- Does `--branch` get validated as an existing branch? A typo currently produces a git error buried in an exception
- Does `--since` accept arbitrary strings and pass them to `git log --since=`? Malformed values fail late
- Does `--json` suppress ALL non-JSON output, including Ink rendering and `ink-spinner` output? Currently the JSON path short-circuits before `render(<GitrelicApp />)` — verify nothing else writes to stdout during the run
- Are exit codes correct? (0 = success, non-zero = error — CI consumers depend on this.) The JSON path uses `process.exit(0/1)`; the Ink path relies on Ink's natural exit. Does an analyzer throw in Ink mode leave the process hanging or exit cleanly?

### 3. Web Server Security (`src/index.tsx` → `serveWebDashboard`)

The `--web` flag starts an HTTP server on port 7777 serving `apps/web/dist` + the in-memory report. Review for:

- **Path traversal** — the current check is `resolved.startsWith(webDist + path.sep)`. Verify:
  - On Windows, `path.sep` is `\` — does `webDist` include a trailing separator mismatch?
  - What about `req.url` containing encoded `%2e%2e` sequences? `path.resolve` will decode them, but the URL parser may not
  - Symlinks inside `webDist` that escape the directory — `path.resolve` won't catch these
  - Static analysis (CodeQL `js/path-injection`) does not recognize post-resolve `startsWith` checks as sanitizers. The current code sanitizes input by rejecting `..` and null bytes explicitly before `path.join` — verify that rejection is still the first thing the handler does
- **`URL#pathname` vs `fileURLToPath`** — grep `src/` for `.pathname` on any `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`. On Windows, `pathname` returns `/C:/Users/...` with a leading slash before the drive letter, which `node:fs` can't open. Every such site must use `fileURLToPath(new URL(..., import.meta.url))` instead. This is the kind of bug that will pass every macOS/Linux smoke test and only surface when a Windows user files an issue.
- **Port 7777 hardcoded** — if the port is in use, `server.listen(7777)` throws. No fallback to the next free port. At minimum, the error message should be helpful
- **Server shutdown** — there is no SIGINT/SIGTERM handler. Pressing Ctrl+C leaves the server orphaned (Ink may swallow the signal). Verify the process actually dies
- **Report endpoint** — `GET /gitrelic-report.json` serves the in-memory `GitrelicReport`. Verify `Content-Type` is set and no other data (e.g. env vars, stack traces) can leak
- **MIME map** — the hardcoded map covers `.html/.js/.css/.json/.svg`. Fonts, images, source maps, and WASM fall through to `text/plain`. Is that a problem for the dashboard?

### 4. Ink Component Patterns

Ink (React for terminals) has specific rules that differ from browser React. Review `apps/cli/src/components/App.tsx` and `src/index.tsx`'s inline `GitrelicApp`:

- `useEffect` with async operations must handle unmount. The current `useEffect(() => { runGitrelic(...).then(...).catch(...) }, [])` has no cleanup — if the user Ctrl-C's mid-scan, does anything leak?
- `runGitrelic` can take several minutes on large repos. Is there any way to cancel it? Currently no
- Components rendering large data (all 22 analyzer reports) should not re-render excessively — check for unstabilized object/array props passed to memoized children
- `setProgress(string)` is called frequently from inside `runGitrelic`. Verify it doesn't trigger full tree re-renders

### 5. `App.tsx` Phases

- `loading` — progress string updates while `runGitrelic` runs
- `results` — displays the report
- `error` — surfaces errors from `runGitrelic`
- `--web` transition — "Opening web dashboard..." is set, then `serveWebDashboard` blocks forever on `server.listen`. Does the UI show anything useful during that wait?

Verify:

- Error phase shows the full error message and exits non-zero (currently it only `setError(err.message)` and the UI keeps running forever)
- `showShame` and `showParallel` flags correctly gate their panels

### 6. Process Hygiene

- After Ink renders results, does the process exit cleanly? Ink can leave stdin in raw mode if not shut down properly
- Any stray `console.log` or `process.stdout.write` from core analyzers will corrupt the Ink UI — grep `packages/core/src` for any stdout writes

### 7. Published-Package Runtime Parity

The monorepo layout and the published tarball layout are **not the same**. Anything the CLI reads at runtime from a path relative to its own `dist/index.js` must exist in both layouts, or it'll work in development and crash on `npx gitrelic`. This is the class of bug that caused `--web` to throw `ENOENT: node_modules/web/dist/index.html` on every published version up through 1.4.2 — the CI smoke test only exercised `--json` and missed it entirely.

Verify on every audit:

- **`files` field in `apps/cli/package.json`** — does it include everything the runtime touches? Currently `["dist"]`. If the CLI reads anything outside `dist/` at runtime (web assets, templates, config defaults, etc.), it's a ticking bomb. Grep `src/` for `readFileSync`, `existsSync`, `createReadStream`, `import()`, and any `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` — every resolved path must land under `dist/` after build.
- **Every `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` in `src/`** — trace the resolved path in **both** the monorepo layout (`apps/cli/dist/index.js`) and the published layout (`node_modules/gitrelic/dist/index.js`). If they differ, the referenced asset must be bundled into `dist/` at build time via a tsup `onSuccess` hook or similar.
- **tsup `onSuccess` copy hooks** — any script that stages assets into `dist/` must **fail loudly** when its source is missing, not silently skip. Check that each hook (currently `scripts/copy-web-dist.mjs`) has an `existsSync` guard followed by `process.exit(1)` with a helpful message that mentions the fix (e.g., "run `pnpm --filter @gitrelic/web build` first, or use `pnpm build` at the repo root").
- **Turbo build ordering via workspace deps** — if the CLI's build depends on another workspace package's output being copied in, that package must be declared as a workspace dependency of the CLI (even if only a `devDependency`), otherwise turbo runs the builds in parallel and you get flaky/broken CLI tarballs. Check `apps/cli/package.json` — any workspace package whose output ends up inside `apps/cli/dist/` must appear in `devDependencies` as `workspace:*`.
- **`fileURLToPath` vs `URL#pathname`** — any runtime path derived from `import.meta.url` must go through `fileURLToPath`. See the bullet in §3 for the Windows rationale. This check belongs here too because the failure mode is cross-platform parity, not just web-server-specific.
- **Install smoke test coverage** — the CI `install-smoke` job packs the tarball and installs it cleanly. It should exercise **every** user-facing code path the CLI supports, not just the happy path. Current coverage as of 1.4.3: `--json` (report shape assertions) and `--web` (HTTP probes). Flag any newly-added flag or mode that isn't covered.
- **Pack-and-diff manually** — when in doubt, run `cd apps/cli && pnpm pack && tar -tzf gitrelic-*.tgz | sort > /tmp/tarball.txt` and compare against what `src/` expects at runtime. Any `src/` file reference that isn't in the tarball is a latent crash.

## How to Run

Dispatch a `feature-dev:code-reviewer` agent. Start with the packaging invariant (§1), then published-package runtime parity (§7), then web server security (§3), then Commander flag validation (§2). Skip style issues entirely.

When §7 flags anything that changes what ships in the tarball, verify the fix with a real pack-and-install cycle: `cd apps/cli && pnpm pack && (in a clean /tmp dir) npm install /path/to/gitrelic-*.tgz && ./node_modules/.bin/gitrelic --path /some/repo --web`. Don't trust the monorepo build alone — it's precisely the layouts-are-different bugs that §7 exists to catch.
